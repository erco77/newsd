TODO LIST

> Add an error counter and configurable 'max errors', so that too many errors
  close the connection.  Bots try probing for the entire usenet hierarchy with
  a bunch of GROUP commands. Should give 'Too many errors. Goodbye.'

  Either that, or setup a fail2ban that monitors the log for too many 
  specific errors, and bans the remote IP.

> Add 'newsd -logreopen' so that logrotate.conf can use as a 'postrotate' command

> Add an optional number flag to '-logrotate' so #rotations saved can be specified (.1, .2, etc)

> Change debug flags to use letters instead of magnitude values (like mailrecv)
