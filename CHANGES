newsd -- Change Log
-------------------

1.54 -- July 26, 2022
        - Added ErrorLog.Hex to newsd.conf
	  Translates non-ascii text messages from remote to <0x##> format
	  Default: on
	  (Helps fail2ban ignore control character garbage from remotes)

1.53 -- July 13, 2022
        - Change 'Connection from' message to show pid of child, not server.
	- Include remote ip in all GOT messages, to help fail2ban filters

1.52 -- October 4, 2018
        - Added KEEPALIVE to TCP connections
	- Fixed problem with -mailgateway, where lock errors weren't causing
	  newsd to report a non-zero exit code
        - Removed umask and forced mode bits on files, so that now:
		> Bootscript can control newsd's umask in daemon mode
		  (by setting it before starting newsd)
		> Shell scripts invoking 'newsd -mailgateway' can also control
		  newsd's umask for created files

1.51 -- September 19, 2018
	- Added -preserve-date flag (to gateway git commits with comit dates)

1.50 -- November 28, 2017
        - Fixed problem with multiline subjects not preserving whitespace at split
        - Don't rewrite Message-ID if supplied by client
        - Article search now starts with recent messages
        - Article search now handles new modulus dirs

1.45 -- ??
        - Fix for communication problem w/opera 9 news readers

	- sprintf() -> snprintf()
	- code made 80 column compliant 
	- Added popen() return value check in Server.C
	- Removed cruft
        - Denial of service fix: "GROUP fltk" would create a 
          .info file in the fltk spool dir, causing 'LIST'
          to no longer list the fltk.xxx news dirs.

1.44 -- October 19, 2005

	- Method name change: ReformatArticle -> ParseArticle
	- Important fix to multiline headers being split during

	  mistaken as an xover field delimiter
	- Converted Article class to use STL strings internally
	- Fixed problem with multiline header parsing, cited
	  RFC's

	  msg starts msg count at 1
	- Documented error handling for methods returning errors
	- Added article start/end range checks to
	  HEAD/BODY/ARTICLE/STAT, eg. '423 No Such Article In
	  Group'
	- Server class uses new Overview() method with string
	  return type.
	- Various important fixes to -mailgateway; removed
	  redundant header loop (looks like a diff error crept
	  in), missing \n at end of Errors-To:, and added error
	  detection + debug output for popen()/pclose()
	- Fixed NULL checks for char* oriented messageid/from
	- Changed the NewsHostname and LogFile configuration
	  directives to ServerName and ErrorLog, respectively to
	  match Apache.

	- The Server class no longer uses the "find" command to
	  get a list of newsgroups (STR #2)
	- Group::Post() didn't start at the last message, so it
	  could reuse deleted message IDs and cause the end ID
	  to be incorrect (STR #3).
	- Group::BuildInfo() is now implemented so that it is no
	  longer neccessary to create the .info file in the
	  inn2newsd.sh script (STR #4)
